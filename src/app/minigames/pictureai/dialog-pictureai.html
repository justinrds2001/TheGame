    <p>
      The objective of the Mini-GPT4 Picture Describe Challenge is to test 
      your visual recognition and describing skills by viewing an image and 
      describing this image. Your description will be compared to a description
      written by the Mini-GPT4 AI who has viewed the same image. The goal of
      this minigame is to show you, the player, to what extend AI can understand
      images and describe what is happening in them.
