            title: 'Shark Finning: Threatening the Existence of Magnificent Marine Predators',
            text: 'Sharks are a type of fish that are known to live in salty water, except for the bull and the rivers sharks which can live in both salty and fresh waters. They are large animals at the top of the food chain, which means that they have limited predators feeding on them. They come in various species and are a sister group to the rays. Although sharks are not very harmless to human beings, research shows that only 12 people are killed by sharks every year, while human beings kill a worrying 100 million sharks annually, the marine animals are facing extinction if something is not done to protect them. This essay explores sharks and the risks they are facing in the hands of human beings, and includes a case study about the same issue. Sharks are amazing marine animals which have all the features of fish, including a cartilaginous skeleton and dermal denticles which protect them from mechanical damage to their skin in addition to enabling them to swim properly. Common species include the hammerhead, great white, blue, tiger and mako sharks. These marine animals are apex predators. This means that they are at the end of the marine food chain and are preyed on by only a few organisms. Another interesting fact about sharks is that the marine animals, anciently know to mariners as ‘marine dogs’ have replaceable teeth. They occasionally shed their teeth which people use as cheap souvenirs. Although research evidence shows that someone is more likely to be bitten by a fellow human than a shark, humans continue to kill the animals for commercial or sporting purposes, threatening their population. The sharks can inflict lethal bites, with the tiger shark and the great white being some of deadliest species. Shark fin soup is a popular delicacy in China and is served in important occasions such as weddings and other social ceremonies. While previously fin soup was a preserve of the rich, the increasing economic power of the people means that more and more people can afford it. However, this comes at the cost of decreasing shark population. Research indicates at the current rate of shark population decline, a majority of the species could be extinct in 30 years since finning causes up to 100 million shark deaths annually. While in the United States there is a specific law (Shark Finning Prohibition Act) that restricts shark finning and calls for international initiatives to ban the practice, there is a lack of a strict monitoring and control program for finning and international shark trade globally. One of the obvious effects of a declining shark population is the disruption of the ecological balance, especially seeing that these marine predators are at the top of the marine food chain. For example, when shark numbers decrease, their prey multiply and in turn wipe out species lower in the food chain, with far reaching consequences on the marine ecological balance. Taking initiatives to ban finning and trade of shark products can go a long way in protecting these marine animals from extinction. In conclusion, sharks are amazing marine animals sitting at the top of the underwater food chain. Although some shark species are capable of inflicting lethal bites, sharks are essentially less harmless than most other marine and land animals. Human activities are threatening the big fish’s population, which could lead to an impact on the ecological balance in the marine environment. It is imperative that finning and other human activities that put sharks at risk are banned or, at the very least, regulated to protect the marine animals from extinction.',

            title: 'Majestic Giants: Discovering the Wonders of Elephants',
            text: "Elephants, the largest land mammals on Earth, have captivated human imagination for centuries. Known for their immense size, intelligence, and social structure, these gentle giants hold a special place in our hearts. In this article, we delve into the fascinating world of elephants, exploring their physical characteristics, behavior, and conservation efforts. Elephants are truly remarkable creatures, characterized by their unmistakable trunks, elongated tusks, and large, fan-like ears. Their trunks, which are versatile appendages, are used for a variety of tasks, such as grasping objects, socializing, and even spraying water. African elephants are the largest of the two species, standing up to 13 feet tall and weighing around 12,000 pounds, while Asian elephants are slightly smaller. Their tusks, which are elongated incisor teeth, serve several purposes, including defense, digging for water, and gathering food. Elephants possess complex social structures, living in tight-knit family groups called herds. Led by a matriarch, these groups consist of related females and their offspring. The matriarch's experience and knowledge guide the herd's movements and decision-making processes. Male elephants, known as bulls, usually live solitary lives or form temporary bachelor groups. Communication among elephants is multifaceted, involving vocalizations, body postures, and infrasonic sounds that can travel long distances. Elephants are highly intelligent and exhibit a wide range of emotions. They display empathy, compassion, and even mourning behaviors when a member of their herd passes away. Their memory is exceptional, enabling them to recognize individuals and remember locations of vital resources such as water and food. Unfortunately, elephants face numerous threats, including habitat loss, poaching for ivory, and conflicts with humans. In response, dedicated conservation organizations and governments around the world have been working tirelessly to protect these magnificent creatures. Efforts include the establishment of protected areas, anti-poaching patrols, and community-based conservation initiatives. International agreements, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), have been instrumental in regulating the trade of elephant products and preventing the illegal ivory trade. Education and awareness campaigns have also played a crucial role in promoting conservation and reducing demand for ivory. Elephants are awe-inspiring animals that capture our imagination with their size, intelligence, and social complexity. Through conservation efforts and public awareness, we can ensure the long-term survival of these majestic giants. Let us continue to appreciate and protect these gentle creatures, ensuring that future generations can marvel at their magnificence.",

            title: 'Democracy: The Power of the People Unleashed',
            text: 'Democracy, a system of government where power rests with the people, is a cornerstone of modern society. It empowers citizens to participate in decision-making, safeguards individual rights, and promotes social progress. In this information piece, we delve into the concept of democracy, exploring its principles, forms, benefits, and challenges. At its core, democracy is founded on principles of political equality, popular sovereignty, and respect for individual rights. It provides citizens with the right to vote, ensuring that every voice is heard and every vote counts. Furthermore, democracy upholds the rule of law, protecting civil liberties, freedom of speech, and peaceful assembly. Transparency, accountability, and separation of powers are crucial components of democratic governance, promoting checks and balances to prevent the abuse of authority. Democracy manifests in various forms across the world, including representative democracy, direct democracy, and hybrid systems. Representative democracy involves elected representatives who make decisions on behalf of the people, while direct democracy allows citizens to participate directly in decision-making through referendums or town hall meetings. Some countries adopt hybrid systems, combining elements of both. Each form has its strengths and limitations, and their effectiveness depends on the specific context and the engagement of the citizenry. Democracy brings numerous benefits to societies. By enabling citizen participation, it fosters social cohesion, inclusivity, and a sense of ownership. It provides a platform for diverse voices to be heard, fostering innovation and creativity. Democracy also promotes stability and peaceful transitions of power through regular elections, reducing the likelihood of political violence. Furthermore, democratic societies tend to enjoy higher standards of living, better education, healthcare, and social welfare programs, as decision-making reflects the needs and aspirations of the people. The respect for human rights and freedoms inherent in democracy nurtures a culture of tolerance, diversity, and respect for the individual. While democracy holds tremendous potential, it faces significant challenges. These include voter apathy, political polarization, the influence of money in politics, and the rise of populism. Moreover, emerging technologies and disinformation campaigns can undermine the integrity of elections and erode public trust. To safeguard democracy, it is essential to promote civic education, encourage citizen engagement, and ensure the protection of free and independent media. Strengthening institutions, such as an impartial judiciary and independent electoral bodies, is crucial. International cooperation and support for democratic values can also help counter authoritarian threats and protect democracy globally. Democracy empowers individuals, promotes social progress, and upholds fundamental rights and freedoms. While facing challenges, it remains an invaluable system of governance that allows the voices of the people to shape their collective destiny. Nurturing and safeguarding democracy requires ongoing commitment, active citizen participation, and a collective effort to uphold its principles and values.',

            title: 'Depiction of Totalitarian Society in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-four',
            text: 'George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) is a science fiction novel based in a critical dystopia, written at the end of the Second World War. The start of the twentieth century brought about advancements in technology and was a catalyst for a new modern society. However, this was a time where fascist regimes were starting to come into power, and the abusive ferocity of these ideologies were witnessed first-hand by Orwell. Lots of ideas in the book came from previously existing ideologies and regimes, and most of the technology Orwell had predicted has a lot of resemblance to what we see today. The purpose of the text was for the audience to receive a warning about what would happen if a totalitarian ruling world were to materialize and that we should pay attention to how language is becoming increasingly corrupt, as it can eventually control our opinions. As we know the dystopia Orwell envisioned did not come into fruition as democracy ultimately won out in the cold war, showcased by the fall of the berlin wall and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, this remains an important novel even to 21st Century readers, as a lot of aspects in today’s society, such as surveillance, can be compared to an Orwellian dystopia. In this investigation I will be using “Orwellian” to describe different articles. The adjective “Orwellian” is still a term thrown around today – however the way most people use it today actually contradicts the meaning of Orwell’s message. From the surface it seems to describe something as authoritarian, as 1984’s dystopia was based around a totalitarian regime. However, its true meaning takes a lot more insight. “Orwell spent most of his life fighting anti-democratic forces from both the left and the right wing, and was concerned with how such ideologies proliferate. One of his most profound insights was how language shapes our thoughts and opinions. ” In 1984 we see clear methods of controlling the population, such as surveillance. However, brainwashing also occurs through a constant influx of propaganda and facts manufactured to support the party’s claims. The regime also uses doublespeak which uses words “not to convey meaning but to undermine it, corrupting the very ideas they refer to”. For example, the motto of Oceania is “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength”. This is a deliberate contradiction, written on the ministry of truth, to condition those who read it into undermining their true meaning. The official dialect of Oceania, Newspeak, has further influenced the society into narrower minds. The language contains only simple acronyms and concrete nouns, eliminating language complex enough to encourage critical thought. This affects what Orwell calls “doublethink” – the act of holding two opposite ideas and believing in both simultaneously, using logic against logic or suspending disbelief in the contradiction. The regime does this to eradicate individuality almost completely, and leave ones thought in uncertainty about where the truth actually lies.',
