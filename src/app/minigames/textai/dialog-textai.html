  <h1 class="mt-4">Human or AI Article?</h1>
  <h3 class="mt-4">Objective:</h3>
  <p>
    The objective of the Human or AI Article game is to test your ability to
    distinguish between articles written by humans and those generated by
    artificial intelligence (AI) models. You will read a series of articles and
    make educated guesses about their origins, determining whether each article
    was written by a human or by AI.
  </p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Rules:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Each round of the game presents you with an article to read and evaluate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Read the article carefully, paying attention to the writing style,
      structure, language, and overall content.
    </li>
    <li>
      Based on your analysis, make a guess whether the article was written by a
      human or by AI.
    </li>
    <li>
      Choose your answer by selecting the appropriate option provided, such as
      "Human" or "AI".
    </li>
    <li>
      You will receive immediate feedback on your guess, indicating whether your
      answer was correct or incorrect.
    </li>
    <li>
      The game will keep track of your score, tallying the number of correct
      guesses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continue playing subsequent rounds, where each round features a new
      article to evaluate and guess.
    </li>
    <li>
      The difficulty level may increase as you progress, featuring articles that
      are more challenging to determine their authorship.
    </li>
    <li>
      The game can be played individually or in a competitive mode with multiple
      players, comparing scores to see who can make the most accurate guesses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use your knowledge of writing styles, language nuances, and contextual
      cues to make informed guesses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remember that AI models have been trained on vast amounts of data and can
      mimic human writing to a certain extent, so be attentive and critical in
      your evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have fun and challenge yourself to become an astute judge of written
      content!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Tips:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Consider the overall coherence and flow of the article. Humans tend to
      express ideas in a more organic and nuanced manner, while AI-generated
      articles may exhibit patterns or repetitive phrases.
    </li>
    <li>
      Look for subtle indicators of authorship, such as personal anecdotes,
      humor, or subjective viewpoints, which are more commonly found in
      human-written articles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pay attention to the complexity and depth of the article's analysis. AI
      models may excel in generating vast amounts of content but can sometimes
      lack deeper insights or nuanced perspectives.
    </li>
    <li>
      Be mindful of grammatical and syntactical errors, as AI models may
      occasionally produce minor mistakes or inconsistencies that humans are
      less likely to make.
    </li>
    <li>
      Compare the article to your own understanding and familiarity with human
      writing. Trust your instincts and intuition when making your guess.
    </li>
    <li>
      Learn from each round, analyzing the articles and feedback to refine your
      ability to discern human and AI-authored content.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enjoy the challenge of distinguishing between human and AI writing and
      appreciate the advancements in AI technology!
