  <h3 class="mt-4">Objective:</h3>
  <p>
    The objective of the DALL·E Draw Challenge is to test your artistic skills
    and creativity by drawing something related to a given theme on an HTML
    canvas. Your drawing will be compared to an image generated by the DALL·E AI
    model to see how well you captured the essence of the theme. The goal of
    this minigame is to show you, the player, to what extend AI can be creative
    and how it can be used to help you in your creative process.
